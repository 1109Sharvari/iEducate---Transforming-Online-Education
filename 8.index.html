                        that are accessible for use and not just for display
                        purposes.
                        A library provides physical (hard copies) or digital
                        access (soft copies) materials, and may be a physical
                        location or a virtual space, or both.
                        A library's collection can include printed materials and
                        other physical resources in many formats such as DVD, CD
                        and cassette as well as access to information, music or

                    <h3>Largest Play Ground</h3>
                    <p>A playground, playpark, or play area is a place designed
                        to provide an environment for children that facilitates
                        play, typically outdoors. While a playground is usually
                        designed for children.
                        some are designed for other age groups, or people with
                        disabilities. A playground might exclude children below
                        (or above) a certain age.
                        Modern playgrounds often have recreational equipment
                        such as the seesaw, merry-go-round, swingset, slide,
                        jungle gym, chin-up bars, sandbox.
                        and mazes, many of which help children develop physical
                        coordination, strength, and flexibility.</p>

                    <p>A healthy diet may contain fruits, vegetables, and whole
                        grains, and may include little to no processed food or
                        sweetened beverages.
                        The requirements for a healthy diet can be met from a
                        variety of plant-based and animal-based foods, although
                        additional sources of vitamin B12 are needed for those
                        following a vegan diet.
                        Various nutrition guides are published by medical and
                        governmental institutions to educate individuals on what
                        they should be eating to be healthy.
                        Nutrition facts labels are also mandatory in some
                        countries to allow consumers to choose between foods
                        based on the components relevant to health.</p>

            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p class="pihu">It is generally accepted that the first inhabitants
                of North America migrated from Siberia by way of the Bering land
                bridge and arrived at least 12,000 years ago; however, some
                evidence suggests
                an even earlier date of arrival. The Clovis culture, which
                appeared around 11,000 BC, is believed to represent the first
                wave of human settlement of the Americas.This was likely the
                first of three major waves of migration into North America;
                later waves brought the ancestors of present-day Athabaskans,
                Aleuts, and Eskimos.
                Over time, indigenous cultures in North America grew
                increasingly sophisticated, and some, such as the pre-Columbian
                Mississippian culture in the southeast.</p>
